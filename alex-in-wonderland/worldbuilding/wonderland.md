# Wonderland

## Overview

Wonderland is a magical realm that exists beneath the ordinary world, accessible through hidden entrances like manholes, storm drains, and forgotten doorways. It's not a sewer or underground cavern in the traditional sense—it's an entirely separate dimension that occupies the same physical space, hidden from those who aren't meant to find it.

**Purpose**: Wonderland appears to those who need it, though what they need isn't always what they think they're looking for. It's a place of transformation, wonder, and self-discovery.

**Entry**: Usually through falling or accident, often during moments of transition or crisis. Storm-opened manholes, hidden doors, a wrong turn in a familiar place. Entry is rarely intentional.

**Exit**: The way back only opens when Wonderland decides someone is ready to leave. Could be hours, days, or longer. Forcing the exit before you're "ready" is impossible.

## Geography & Locations

### The Tunnel
- Where newcomers arrive after falling
- Round, smooth walls that glow with bioluminescent patterns
- Lined with alcoves containing impossible objects (backwards clocks, rose-filled teacups, indoor stars)
- The light moves like liquid, responding to presence and emotion
- Opens into the main city after a gentle curve

### The Glowing City (Central Hub)
- Organic architecture: buildings grow like mushrooms or flowers
- All structures glow from within with soft, shifting light
- No traditional streets—pathways flow like rivers
- Hanging gardens with exposed roots creating curtains of green
- Bridges made of glass/crystal arcing overhead
- Layout follows spirals and circles rather than grids
- The Welcome Bell rings when the market opens

### Districts (To Develop):
- The Market District - where the story begins
- The Garden District - mentioned in outline, needs development
- The Bell Tower - central landmark
- The Deep/Dangerous Heart - where the climax occurs
- Others as needed

## Rules & Logic

### Physics
- Gravity is negotiable: things can hang in mid-air, water can flow upward
- Time is "flexible" but doesn't seem to affect aging
- Distance and space don't work like the normal world—places can be closer or farther based on need
- The fall from above slows gently rather than causing injury

### Magic Properties
- **Responsiveness**: Wonderland reacts to emotions, needs, and thoughts
  - Walls glow brighter in response to speech
  - Paths appear or shift based on where you need to go
  - Objects appear that reflect visitors' inner states

- **Transformation**: Things are constantly changing, growing, shifting
  - Buildings sprout like living things
  - Nothing stays exactly the same from visit to visit

- **Intent Over Reality**: What something is "meant" to be matters more than what it physically is
  - A cup of roses can exist because the idea makes sense here
  - Backwards clocks work because time is different

### Inhabitants' Rules
- Wonderland creatures are born from the magic itself
- Some are more human-like, others are elemental or abstract
- They understand Wonderland's logic instinctively
- They can guide visitors but can't force the exit to appear

## Inhabitants

### Types of Beings

**The Hummingbird Creature** (Named Character - needs name):
- Mix of bird and tiny humanoid
- Iridescent wings, human face the size of a thumb
- Cheerful, knowledgeable, slightly mysterious
- Knows more than they reveal
- First guide for newcomers

**The Varied**:
- Some walk on two legs, others have wings, tails, extra limbs
- Skin that changes color like mood rings
- Tall as lampposts or round as beach balls
- One made entirely of water
- Diverse in form, united in acceptance of Wonderland's strangeness

**To Develop**:
- The Mapmaker (Chapter 4)
- Alex's first real friend (Chapter 6)
- The Council/Leaders (Chapter 13)
- Antagonistic forces (if any)

### Culture
- Welcoming to newcomers but patient about explanations
- Used to bizarre questions and confused visitors
- Operate on Wonderland's logic naturally
- Market culture: trading, celebration, community gathering
- The Welcome Bell signals important events

## Visual Style & Atmosphere

### Colors & Light
- Bioluminescent glow from within all structures
- Soft, shifting colors: blues, greens, ambers, violets
- Light that pulses like breathing
- Sparkles and glimmers in the air
- Mist that smells of flowers and rain

### Sensory Details
- **Sound**: Bells, wind chimes, distant laughter, music that might be natural
- **Smell**: Flowers, fresh rain, something indefinable and magical
- **Touch**: Surfaces that feel alive, warm, responsive
- **Taste**: To be developed in market scenes
- **Overall**: Inviting rather than threatening, wonder over horror

### Mood
- Whimsical but not silly
- Mysterious but not dark
- Magical but with internal consistency
- Slightly overwhelming at first, then comforting
- A place that feels both foreign and somehow right

## Inspiration & References

### Literary
- *Alice in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll (obviously—the name, the fall, the nonsense logic)
- *The Phantom Tollbooth* by Norton Juster (wordplay, learning through adventure)
- *Coraline* by Neil Gaiman (other world accessed through ordinary passage, return when ready)
- *The Chronicles of Narnia* by C.S. Lewis (transformation through otherworld journey)

### Visual
- Bioluminescent caves and underwater scenes
- Art Nouveau organic architecture
- Ghibli films (especially *Spirited Away*—otherworld with internal logic, transformation)
- Aurora borealis color palettes

### Conceptual
- The idea that magical places exist alongside ordinary ones
- Wonderland as therapy/healing space (subconscious)
- Coming-of-age through literally entering another world
- The underground as a place of transformation (seeds growing in darkness before emerging)

## Notes for Development

- **Consistency**: Even with flexible rules, need internal logic that stays steady
- **Districts**: Each area of Wonderland should have distinct character and purpose
- **Danger Level**: Keep age-appropriate—wonder and challenge without trauma
- **Symbolism**: Wonderland elements should reflect Alex's inner journey
- **Uniqueness**: How is this Wonderland different from Carroll's? (More warm, more community-focused, more purposeful in its magic)
