# Ideas & Brainstorming

## Initial Concepts

- **Modern Portal**: Using a manhole instead of a rabbit hole grounds the fantasy in contemporary reality
- **Storm as Catalyst**: The storm literally tears open the boundary between worlds
- **Underground Wonder**: Subverting expectations—what's below isn't dark sewers but glowing magic
- **Loneliness Theme**: Alex is alone at home (working mom, distracted sister), finds belonging in Wonderland

## Things to Explore

### Character Development
- What hobby or special interest does Alex have that could translate to Wonderland skills?
- Does Alex have a best friend in the real world? Or is loneliness part of why Wonderland called to him?
- What does Alex learn about his mom during this journey? (Parallel between her working hard/being absent and him learning to appreciate that?)
- Maya's role: Will she notice Alex is gone? Could be interesting tension if time works differently

### Wonderland Elements
- **The Market**: What gets traded? Memories? Stories? Dreams? Keep it creative and age-appropriate
- **The Mapmaker**: Maps that show where you need to go rather than where things actually are?
- **Different Districts**: Garden (growth), Mirror (self-reflection), Tower (perspective), Deep (challenges)
- **The Crisis**: What goes wrong in Wonderland? Light fading? Borders collapsing? Balance disrupted?

### Plot Points
- Why was Alex specifically drawn to Wonderland? Is it random or does he have something Wonderland needs?
- The hummingbird creature hints Alex was "looking for something"—what is it? Friendship? Purpose? Adventure? Himself?
- How does Alex's journey mirror what Wonderland needs? (His transformation heals Wonderland?)
- Consider: Other human visitors past or present? Is Alex unique?

### Magic System
- Wonderland responds to emotional truth
- Things work based on what they "mean" rather than what they physically are
- The exit appears when you're ready—but what determines readiness?
- Can Alex bring anything back from Wonderland? Or just memories and growth?

## Questions to Answer

- [ ] What's Alex's last name? (Keep it ordinary to contrast with extraordinary journey)
- [ ] Exact age: 10 or 11? (Consider what's most relatable for target audience)
- [ ] How long is Alex in Wonderland in story time? Days? Week?
- [ ] How much time passes in the real world? (Same time? Less? More?)
- [ ] Does Alex tell anyone about Wonderland when he returns? Or is it his secret?
- [ ] Will there be sequels or is this a standalone? (Affects ending)
- [ ] Name for the hummingbird creature?
- [ ] What exactly is the crisis in Wonderland?
- [ ] What does Alex risk/sacrifice at the climax?

## Random Ideas & Inspiration

### Possible Scenes
- Alex trying to explain cell phones or video games to Wonderland inhabitants
- A meal in Wonderland where the food does unexpected things
- Alex's reflection in Wonderland water/mirrors showing how he's changing
- The moment when Alex chooses to stay and help rather than escape
- Rain in Wonderland (connects back to the storm that opened the manhole)

### Character Names to Consider
- The Mapmaker: "Atlas"? "Meridian"? Something geography-related but not too on-the-nose
- The hummingbird: "Glimmer"? "Dart"? "Shimmer"? Something that evokes their nature

### Themes to Weave In
- Sometimes getting lost is how you find yourself
- Home is where you're understood and valued
- Curiosity without wisdom is dangerous, but wisdom without curiosity is empty
- The ordinary world contains magic if you know how to see it
- Growing up means accepting responsibility, not losing wonder

### Cool Wonderland Details
- Clocks with backwards hands that tell you how much time you have left
- Gardens that grow from emotions instead of seeds
- Music that you can see as colored light
- Books where the story changes based on who's reading
- Stairs that lead to different places depending on your mood

### Possible Chapter Titles (Evoke Alice's chapters)
- "The Fall" ✓
- "A Very Peculiar Market"
- "Advice from a Hummingbird"
- "In Which Everything Changes"
- "The Mapmaker's Impossible Atlas"
- "Through the Looking Glass (Maybe Literally?)"
- "A Garden of Questions"
- "The Bell Tower Rings Twice"
- "What Alex Found There"

## Notes from Chapter 1 Draft

**What worked:**
- The storm sequence creates urgency and explains the manhole
- The fall sequence with glowing walls and strange objects builds wonder
- Landing is gentle (trampoline effect) - keeps it from being traumatic
- The city reveal is cinematic and exciting
- Hummingbird creature is charming and mysterious
- Ending on Alex making the choice to explore gives him agency

**To develop further:**
- Alex's specific traits that make him relatable (hobby, school life, friendships)
- More sensory details in future chapters (sounds, smells, tastes of Wonderland)
- Balance between wonder and plot progression
- Age-appropriate challenges that feel real without being too dark

**Questions raised:**
- Will Alex keep trying to find exits or will he shift to exploration?
- How soon does the crisis in Wonderland appear?
- What's the first real challenge Alex faces?
- When does he make his first genuine friend?
