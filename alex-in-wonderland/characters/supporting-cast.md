## Notes for Development

- Keep supporting cast distinct but don't overload with detail
- Each character should serve story function first, be memorable second
- Wonderland natives can be weird in appearance but should be emotionally real
- Age-appropriate—fantastical but not frightening
- Many can be gender-neutral or transcend human categories
- Cultural diversity can be represented in Wonderland's varied forms
- Remember: Even minor characters believe they're the hero of their own story
