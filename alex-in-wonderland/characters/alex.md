# Alex

## Basic Info
- **Full Name**: Alex (last name TBD)
- **Age**: 10-11 years old
- **Role**: Protagonist
- **Lives**: Maple Street, suburban neighborhood

## Physical Description
- Wears rain boots and jacket (practical kid)
- Young enough to be curious, old enough to be independent
- (More details to develop: hair color, height, distinguishing features)

## Personality
- **Curious**: Can't resist investigating the unknown—storm damage, open manholes, mysteries
- **Adventurous**: Actively seeks out interesting things after the storm
- **Somewhat reckless**: Leans too close to danger without fully thinking through consequences
- **Independent**: Comfortable being on his own, doesn't wait for permission
- **Observant**: Notices small details (the smell from the manhole, the objects in alcoves during the fall)
- **Brave despite fear**: Screams when falling but keeps moving forward once he lands

## Background
- Mother works third shift at the hospital (often away)
- Has an older sister, Maya, who is more interested in her phone than supervising
- Comfortable with solitude and self-direction
- Previous storm-chasing resulted in finding a baseball—this establishes a pattern of post-storm exploration
- Lives a fairly ordinary suburban life... until now

## Character Arc

**Beginning**:
- Bored, seeking adventure in small ways (storm damage exploration)
- Curious but hasn't faced real consequences for his curiosity
- Takes mother's safety warnings lightly
- Looking for something interesting in an ordinary world

**Middle**:
- Must navigate an impossible world using only his wits and courage
- Learns that curiosity has consequences—both good and dangerous
- Discovers there's more to himself than he realized
- The question shifts from "how do I get home?" to "who am I in this place?"

**End**:
- Returns home changed—more mature, more aware
- Understands the balance between curiosity and wisdom
- Carries Wonderland with him even in the ordinary world
- (Possible: discovers he can return, or that Wonderland is always there for those who need it)

## Relationships

**Maya (sister)**:
- Older, teenage, distracted by her own life
- Dismissive of Alex ("Don't die!" said without real concern)
- Represents the ordinary world's indifference

**Mom**:
- Works hard, often absent due to hospital shifts
- Protective, gives warnings Alex doesn't always heed
- Her absence creates the space for Alex's adventure

**The Hummingbird Creature**:
- First Wonderland inhabitant Alex meets
- Guides him toward the city
- Knows more than they're saying (suggests Alex was "looking for" something)
- Potential recurring guide/friend character

## Notes & Development
- Name choice "Alex" works for the Alice parallel but makes him his own character
- His working-class background (mom's shift work) grounds him as relatable
- Consider: What is Alex actually looking for? What does he need that Wonderland provides?
- Physical description needs development—should be relatable to target audience
- Consider giving him a hobby or special interest that connects to Wonderland skills
