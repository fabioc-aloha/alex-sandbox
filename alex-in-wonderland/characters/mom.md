# Mom

## Basic Info
- **Full Name**: (To be determined—same last name as Alex and Maya)
- **Age**: Late 30s to early 40s
- **Occupation**: Hospital worker (third shift nurse or similar)
- **Role**: Alex's mother, representation of love mixed with absence

## Physical Description
- Tired but kind eyes
- Often in scrubs or just out of scrubs
- Hair pulled back practically
- Warm presence when available
- Signs of hard work and long hours

## Personality
- **Loving**: Genuinely cares about her kids
- **Exhausted**: Works too much, stretched too thin
- **Trying her best**: Single parent or partner also working hard
- **Protective**: Gives safety warnings Alex ignores
- **Guilty**: Knows she's not around enough, can't fix it
- **Strong**: Doing what's necessary to provide for family

## Background
- Works third shift at hospital—gone evenings/nights
- Single parent or partner's presence unclear (focus on her absence)
- Provides for family but at cost of presence
- Wants to be more available, circumstances won't allow
- Worries about Alex but trusts he's generally safe
- Relies on Maya to supervise (doesn't realize Maya checked out)

## Character Arc
**Beginning**:
- Absent due to work during Alex's adventure
- Part of his loneliness equation
- Loves him but isn't there

**End** (Chapter 20):
- Home early (first time in ages?)
- Surprised by Alex's open affection
- Receives his "I love you" with touched confusion
- Opportunity to reconnect, if Alex reaches out

## Relationships

**Alex**: Loves him, worried about him, not present enough
**Maya**: Closer by default (older, more independent)
**Her job**: Demanding, necessary, pulls her away from kids

## Role in Story
- **Absence**: Creates void Alex tries to fill with wonder and adventure
- **Love**: Alex knows she loves him, but love without presence still hurts
- **Return**: Someone Alex can rebuild connection with post-transformation
- **Motivation**: Part of what Alex misses, part of what he needs to change

## Key Moments
- Chapter 1: At work during storm—establishes pattern of absence
- Chapter 8: Hospital badge appears in Wonderland—Alex misses her
- Chapter 20: Home early, receives Alex's transformation with surprise and warmth

## Character Voice
- Warm but rushed
- "Stay safe, sweetheart" / "I love you, be good"
- Tired affection in every sentence
- Guilt beneath surface: "I wish I could..."

## Philosophy
- Doing her best in impossible circumstances
- Work is for the kids, even though it keeps her from them
- Hopes they understand now, know she loves them

## Notes & Development
- Not a bad parent—a realistic struggling parent
- Her absence is circumstantial, not choice
- Working class representation—many kids experience this
- Chapter 20: Alex's change might inspire her to find more balance?
- Alex calling her at work (future action) shows his growth—reaching out
- The love was always there; Alex learns to express need for connection
