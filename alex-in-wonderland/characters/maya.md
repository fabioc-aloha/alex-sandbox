- **Sarcastic**: Default mode of communication, especially with family

## Background

- Used to be closer to Alex when they were both younger
- Teen years created distance—different interests, different worlds
- Has her own friend group, school drama, teenage concerns
- Parents expect her to watch Alex but she's checked out
- Not a bad person—just at an age where little brothers are invisible

## Character Arc
**Beginning**:
- Barely notices Alex exists
- "Don't die!" said without looking up from phone
- Would not notice if he disappeared for hours

**End** (Chapter 20):
- Surprised when Alex seeks connection
- Cautiously agrees to hang out
- Opens door to rebuilt relationship
- Hint that Alex's transformation affects her too

## Relationships

**Alex**: Little brother she's outgrown, mostly ignores
**Mom**: Allies in eye-rolling about family stuff, closer to her than to Alex
**Her friends**: Where her attention is, her real world

## Role in Story
- **Contrast**: Shows Alex's invisible status at home
- **Motivation**: Part of what drove Alex to seek wonder elsewhere
- **Return Challenge**: Someone Alex must reconnect with post-transformation
- **Growth Opportunity**: Will Alex's change inspire her change?

## Key Moments
- Chapter 1: "Don't die!" while on phone—establishes distance
- Chapter 8: Her voice as an echo in Wonderland—Alex misses her

## Character Voice
- Sarcastic, brief, distracted
- "Whatever" / "Sure, I guess" / "Can you not?"
- Rarely makes eye contact during conversation
- One-word answers while scrolling

## Notes & Development
- Not a villain—just a realistic teenager
- Her neglect is passive, not active cruelty
- Chapter 20 hint: She might have been lonely too, just expressed differently
- Future possibility: They rebuild relationship, she learns about Wonderland?
- Represents the ordinary world Alex has to reintegrate into—but differently
