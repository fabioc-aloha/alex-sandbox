# Alex in Wonderland

A fiction story about a young boy who discovers a magical world beneath the streets.

## Story Premise

After a fierce storm tears through his neighborhood, young Alex stumbles upon an open manhole—its cover ripped away by the violent winds and flooding. Peering into the darkness below, curiosity overtakes caution. One misstep sends him tumbling down into the depths, where he discovers not the dank sewers he expected, but a vibrant, impossible world filled with wonder, danger, and magic.

This is Wonderland—a realm that exists beneath our feet, hidden from the ordinary world above. Here, Alex must navigate strange inhabitants, peculiar rules, and fantastical landscapes as he searches for a way home. But the longer he stays, the more he realizes that Wonderland may hold answers to questions he didn't know he was asking.
