## Project Structure Pattern

Fiction writing projects follow a workflow-based organization:

```
project-name/
├── chapters/          # Numbered chapter drafts (00-template, 01-opening, etc.)
├── characters/        # Character profiles and development arcs
├── worldbuilding/     # Setting, rules, locations, magic systems, cultures
├── outlines/          # Plot outlines, story structure, act breakdowns
├── research/          # Reference materials, inspiration, genre research
├── notes/             # Brainstorming, ideas, questions to answer
└── README.md          # Story premise, genre, target audience, themes
```

### Essential Templates

**Chapter Template** (`00-chapter-template.md`):
- POV designation
- Setting/goal metadata
- Content space
- Notes section for revision ideas

**Character Profile**:
- Basic info (name, age, role)
- Physical description
- Personality traits
- Background
- Character arc (beginning → middle → end)
- Relationships
- Development notes

**Story Outline**:
- Logline (one-sentence pitch)
- Three-act structure with plot points
- Key scenes list
- Chapter breakdown with goals

**Worldbuilding Document**:
- Overview and purpose
- Geography & locations
- Rules & logic (how this world differs)
- Inhabitants & culture
- Visual style & atmosphere
- Inspiration & references

## Story Development Workflow

### 1. Foundation (README)
- **Premise**: Core story concept in 2-3 paragraphs
- **Genre & Audience**: Specific genre, age range, reading level
- **Target Length**: Word count and estimated chapter count
- **Themes**: 3-5 core themes to explore

### 2. Outline First
- Start with logline (forces clarity)
- Map three-act structure before detailed plotting
- Identify key scenes that must happen
- Break into chapters with specific goals

### 3. Character Development
- Protagonist gets full profile before Chapter 1
- Supporting characters develop as needed
- Character arcs should mirror plot structure
- Relationships drive emotional stakes

### 4. Worldbuilding Depth
- Define rules before breaking them
- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste)
- Internal consistency > flashy magic
- Culture and inhabitants shape the world

### 5. Iterative Drafting
- First draft prioritizes completion over perfection
- Each chapter includes notes for revision
- Templates maintain consistency
- README tracks overall progress

## Genre-Specific Conventions

### Middle-Grade (Ages 8-12)
- **Length**: 20,000-60,000 words (varies by age range)
- **Chapters**: 10-25 chapters, 1,500-3,000 words each
- **POV**: Third person limited or first person
- **Themes**: Age-appropriate, optimistic overall
- **Challenges**: Real stakes without trauma
- **Voice**: Authentic to age, not condescending

### Young Adult (Ages 12-18)
- **Length**: 50,000-90,000 words
- **Chapters**: 20-40 chapters
- **POV**: Often first person, present or past tense
- **Themes**: Identity, belonging, agency, complex moral questions
- **Challenges**: Higher stakes, mature themes handled appropriately

### Portal Fantasy (Any Age)
- **Entry**: Clear threshold between worlds
- **Rules**: Magic system with internal logic
- **Stakes**: Reason to stay/return home
- **Transformation**: Protagonist changes through journey
- **Return**: Changed perspective on ordinary world

## Creative First Draft Generation

When asked to "be creative" with a first draft:

### Before Writing
1. **Anchor in premise**: What's the core story?
2. **Identify opening need**: What must Chapter 1 accomplish?
3. **Set tone**: Match target audience age and genre expectations

### During Writing
1. **Sensory immersion**: Show through specific details
2. **Character voice**: Dialogue and thought patterns authentic to age
3. **Pacing**: Balance action, description, reflection
4. **Hook**: Open with movement/curiosity/tension
5. **End with momentum**: Close on decision or question

### Draft Quality
- Prioritize **completion** over perfection
- Include **scene notes** for future revision
- Establish **voice** and **tone** consistently
- Create **room for growth** (don't over-explain)

## Template Instantiation

When scaffolding a new fiction project:

1. **Create directory structure** (chapters, characters, worldbuilding, outlines, research, notes)
2. **Generate README** with premise, genre, audience, themes
3. **Create templates**: chapter template, character profile, story outline, worldbuilding doc
4. **Populate initial content**:
   - Protagonist character file
   - Story outline with act structure
   - Worldbuilding foundation document
   - Ideas brainstorming file
5. **First chapter** (if requested): Use templates, establish tone, introduce protagonist, end with forward momentum

## Quality Principles

- **Internal consistency** > external realism (in fantasy/SF)
- **Character agency**: Protagonist drives plot, not vice versa
- **Emotional truth**: Even in impossible worlds, emotions feel real
- **Age-appropriate**: Challenge readers without traumatizing
- **Theme integration**: Weave themes through action, don't lecture
- **Sensory grounding**: Specific details create vivid worlds

## Common Patterns

### Portal Fantasy Setup
1. **Ordinary world**: Establish protagonist's normal life and need
2. **Threshold event**: Storm, accident, curiosity-driven discovery
3. **Entry**: Falling, stepping through, being pulled
4. **Arrival disorientation**: Sensory overload, impossible physics
5. **Guide figure**: Helper who explains (or mystifies)
6. **Choice to continue**: Protagonist agency in exploration

### Three-Act Structure
- **Act 1 (25%)**: Setup, inciting incident, entry into new world/situation, first plot point locks them in
- **Act 2 (50%)**: Complications, midpoint revelation, stakes increase, second plot point forces crisis
- **Act 3 (25%)**: Climax, resolution, return/transformation, new equilibrium

### Character Arcs
- **Beginning**: What they believe/lack/want
- **Middle**: Challenges that confront belief/need/want
- **End**: Transformation, wisdom gained, different perspective

## Session: Alex in Wonderland (2026-02-14)

Applied these principles to create:
- Complete project structure with all templates
- Story premise: Boy falls through manhole into magical Wonderland
- Full Chapter 1 draft (~2,400 words, middle-grade voice)
- Protagonist profile (Alex, 10-11, curious/adventurous)
- 20-chapter outline with three-act structure
- Detailed Wonderland worldbuilding (bioluminescent city, responsive magic, organic architecture)
- Ideas document with brainstorming, questions, scene possibilities

**Key learning**: Fiction projects benefit from the same structured approach as technical projects—templates, progressive disclosure, research-first worldbuilding.
