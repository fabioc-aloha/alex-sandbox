# Writing & Publication Skill

> Patterns for technical writing, academic publication, and content strategy.

## Writing Formats

| Format | Audience | Length | Review |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Academic Paper | Researchers | 4-10K words | Peer (2-6 mo) |
| Workshop Paper | Researchers | 2-4K words | Light (1-2 mo) |
| Trade Publication | Practitioners | 1-2K words | Editorial (2-4 wk) |
| Blog Post | Developers | 500-1.5K words | Self |
| Documentation | Users | Variable | Internal |

## Academic Paper Structure

1. **Abstract** — Problem, approach, results, implications (150-300 words)
2. **Introduction** — Motivation, problem, contributions, outline
3. **Related Work** — Position within existing research
4. **Methodology** — How you did it (reproducible)
5. **Implementation** — Technical details (if applicable)
6. **Evaluation** — Evidence for claims
7. **Discussion** — Interpretation, limitations
8. **Conclusion** — Summary, future work
9. **References** — Venue-specific format

## Writing Principles

- Precision over flair
- Evidence for claims (data or citations)
- Acknowledge limitations
- Active voice preferred
- Define terms on first use
- Break sentences at 25-30 words

## Pitfalls to Avoid

| Bad | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| "might possibly perhaps" | "may" |
| "revolutionary" | "novel approach" |
| "was performed" | "we performed" |
| Jargon without definition | Define on first use |
| Buried contributions | State explicitly in intro |

## Structuring Arguments

**CARS Model (Introductions):**

1. Establish territory (topic importance)
2. Establish niche (gap in knowledge)
3. Occupy niche (your contribution)

**Heilmeier Catechism (Motivation):**

- What are you trying to do?
- How is it done today? Limits?
- What's new in your approach?
- Who cares? What difference?
- What are the risks?

## Audience Adaptation

| Audience | Adjust |
| -------- | ------ |
| Researchers | Add theoretical framing, citations |
| Practitioners | Add code examples |
| Executives | Add business value |
| General tech | Remove jargon |

## Publication Strategy

**Venue sequencing:**

1. Trade publication → immediate visibility
2. arXiv pre-print → establish priority
3. Workshop paper → academic credibility
4. Journal/conference → peer-reviewed validation

**First-time author:**

- Start with lower-barrier venues
- Collaborate with established authors
- Target workshops first
- Conduct user studies (empirical data strengthens)

## Responding to Reviews

| Feedback | Response |
| -------- | -------- |
| "Missing related work" | Add citations, explain positioning |
| "Claims not supported" | Add evidence or soften claims |
| "Unclear methodology" | Expand description |
| "Limited evaluation" | Add studies or acknowledge |

**Response letter**: Thank → Summarize changes → Address each point → Highlight extras
