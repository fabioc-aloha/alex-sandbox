# /dream - Neural Maintenance

Run unconscious processing and architecture health checks.

## Process

1. Use `alex_synapse_health` to validate connections
2. Use `alex_architecture_status` to check overall health
3. Report issues found and repairs needed
4. Suggest consolidation if insights accumulated

## Nature

Dream is automatic maintenance—less interactive than meditation. Run the health checks and report findings.

## Start

Begin neural maintenance now. Validate synaptic connections and report architecture health.
