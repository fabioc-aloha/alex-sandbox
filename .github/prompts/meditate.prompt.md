# /meditate - Knowledge Consolidation

Guide the user through conscious knowledge consolidation using Alex's meditation protocols.

## Process

1. **Reflect**: What was learned in this session?
2. **Connect**: How does this relate to existing knowledge?
3. **Persist**: What should be saved to memory files?
4. **Integrate**: Update relevant `.instructions.md`, `.prompt.md`, or skills

## Important

Always end meditation by actually updating memory files—consolidation without persistence is incomplete.

## Start

Begin the meditation session now. Ask the user what they'd like to consolidate, or review the current session for learnings.
